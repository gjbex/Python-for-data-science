# Bokeh

You can use Bokeh as a plotting backend for pandas.

## What is it?

1. `bokeh_plot.ipynb`: using Bokeh as a plotting beackdnd for pandas.
1. `environment.yml`: conda environment required to run the notebook.
1. `pandas_bokeh_linux64_conda_specs.txt`: conda environment specification.

*Note:* currently (2023-03-22) the bokeh backend for pandas requires
bokeh 2.x, and that has to be specified as an explicit dependency.

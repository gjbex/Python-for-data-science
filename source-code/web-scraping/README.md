# WebScraping

Web scraping can be quite useful to gather data that is not avaialble
through an API.  Here, some sample code is provided for Beautiful Soup,
a web scraping library that is easy to use.


## What is it?

1. `link_web.py`: script that uses Beautiful Soup and NetworkX to
    create a graph representing the links between web pages, starting
    from a given page.
1. `preprocessing`: Python script that scrapes a web page containing FAQs and
   printing them in JSONL format.
